[Neuronal network parameters]

Initial learning rate (ETA) = 0.001
Minimum learning rate (ETA) = 0.00005
Rate of decay for learning rate (ETA) = 0.794183335
Decay rate is applied after this number of propagation = 120000
Number of back propagation threads = 2
Number of testing threads = 1
Number of patterns used to calculate Hessian = 500
Limiting divisor (micron) for learning rate amplification (like 0.10 for 10x limit) = 0.10

[Parameters for controlling pattern distortion during back propagation]

Maximum scale factor change (percent, like 20.0 for 20%) = 15.0
Maximum rotational change (degrees, like 20.0 for 20 degrees) = 15.0
Sigma for elastic distortions (higher numbers are more smooth and less distorted, Simard uses 4.0) = 8.0
Scaling for elastic distortions (higher numbers amplify distortions, Simard uses 0.34) = 0.5
